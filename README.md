### DESCRIPTION:
a little python script to convert images in directory to a pdf.

### MOTIVATION:
i like to see lectures on the internet, than to do "print screen" and save them.
with this script i convert all of them to one PDF.


### DEPENDENCIES:

* pillow
* img2pdf

(install with pip, conda etc.)

#### PLEASE change the path in the "shebang" too (the first line in the script with #!), to your python path !

### INPUT:
A python directory name with images, which found in the current directory you are in.
the images should be in format png or jpg or jpeg.
The images should be ordered like 1.png, 2.png, 3.png .... so the output will be the same order.

### OPTPUT:
A PDF file with all the images in the right order.
the default is "name/of/directory.pdf" but you could input your own file name.
